# Hello-World
I am new to github but the excitement is overwhelming .
Changes - Where to start? I have made so many changes already and only see more in my future . I have a long list of trials and tribulations on this road of life . I am trying to make a complete overhaul on my life-style. Technology and music seem to be the road I want to take for the rest of my journey on this Earth. I like to think that I have always been respected in my community I feel like Covid-19 served its purpose. This pandemic has me "woke".
